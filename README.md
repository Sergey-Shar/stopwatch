# Timer Tabata

## About the project:


This project implements the timer functionality for working on the Tabata protocol.  

We can choose the number of repetitions of training cycles, set the time of work and rest time as well as preparation. 


The idea of this work came to me just during a training session on the Tabata protocol. Then I thought that when I want to do something for the soul, I'll just do it.

### I also wanted to work without the help of frameworks and libraries, so I used the following tools to implement the idea:

- [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/)

- [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/)

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)



With the help of [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) hosting, the deployment of the project is implemented and by following [this](https://tabata-timer-app-932a8.web.app/) link you can see how the application works in the browser
